                <li>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</li>
                <li>Most HTML elements consist of three parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The opening tag (or start tag) marks where the element’s content begins.
                        </li>
                        <li>The closing tag (or end tag) marks the end of the element’s content. The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (/) after the first angle bracket.
                        </li>
                        <li>The content is placed between the element’s opening and closing tags.</li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>

        <h3>HTML Semantic Elements</h3>
        <article>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Semantic HTML, also known as semantic markup, refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning—or semantics—of the content contained within them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page.
                    <br>As opposed to non-semantic HTML, which uses tags that don’t directly convey meaning.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Tags</h2>
        <article><h4>Self Closing Tags</h4>
            In HTML, an opening and closing tag combined into one is known as a self-closing tag.It is used to indicate that there is no content between the opening and closing tags.
            <h4>Closing Tags</h4>
            An opening tag begins a section of page content, and a closing tag ends it. For example, to markup a section of text as a paragraph, you would open the paragraph with an opening paragraph tag and close it with a closing paragraph tag. (closing tags always proceed the element with a /).

        <h2>Elements</h2>
        <article>
            <h4>Block Elements</h4>
            A block element creates a new section on the page. By default, a block-level element stretches to fill 100% of the viewport (i.e., the visible area of the web page) and always starts a new line.
            Common block-level elements include paragraph (p), Page headings (H1-H6), Table, Unordered list (Ul), Ordered list (ol), and div.
            <h4>Line Elements</h4>
            Line elements exist in line with their parent element. Both the width and height of a Line element are set by its content.
            Also, Line elements do not start a new line, meaning you can put multiple of them on the same line.
            Common Line elements include a href (a), Image (img), Emphasis (em); {Italicizes an element}, (strong) bolds an element, (button), and (span).
